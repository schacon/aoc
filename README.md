# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my horrible solutions to the advent of code challenges.

Also proof that I am not a clever programmer. But I do get shit done. So suck it.

## 2025 Notes

This year I'm trying to do them all only using SQLite. To run the solutions, the procedure is usually:

```bash
# load db with data
$ sqlite db.sqlite < load.sql

# solve the problem
$ sqlite db.sqlite < solve.sql
```

Love,
Scott
